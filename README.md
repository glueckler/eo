#empty objects

empty objects is basically just a timer.  i'm pretty new to python, so i think it's cool

`last_session.py` is my database

run `./eo.py` to begin the timer

run `session` to see how long the current session has been

eo will track total time it's been running forever, as well as a weekly summary

(built to track the amount of time i spend making music every week)

Have a day! 'ヽ༼ʘ̚ل͜ʘ̚༽ﾉ'
